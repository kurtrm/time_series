1. FROM + JOIN: first the product of all tables is formed
2. WHERE: the where clause filters rows that do not meet the search condition
3. GROUP BY + (COUNT, SUM, etc): the rows are grouped using the columns in
the group by clause and the aggregation functions are applied on the grouping
4. HAVING: like the WHERE clause, but can be applied after aggregation
5. SELECT: the targeted list of columns are evaluated and returned
6. DISTINCT: duplicate rows are eliminated
- Window functions occur here
7. ORDER BY: the resulting rows are sorted
